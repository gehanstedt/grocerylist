## Description
Grocery List is my version of Eat-Da-Burger App for the Georgia Tech Bootcamp Chapter 13 - MVC Homework assignment.  Grocery List leverage a backend MySQL database to keep track of items for your grocer list.  The application allows entry of new items, allows you do move items from your "Not in Basket" list to your "In Basket" list, and back.  And, you can outright delete items from the list.  It is compatible with Heroku and a free JawsDB MySQL instance.
